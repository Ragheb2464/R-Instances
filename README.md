# R-Instances
This repo contains the stochastic demand scenarios for R test instances. The network structures can be obtained from the referenced cited in:
  - Rahmaniani, Ragheb, Teodor Gabriel Crainic, Michel Gendreau, and Walter Rei. "An Asynchronous Parallel Benders Decomposition Method." (2019).

Each line of the files in this repo contains one scenario where the first columns is the probability and the remaining columns are the corresponding demands.
